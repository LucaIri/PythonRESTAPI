# Python REST API Assignment 2
A program that performs 4 different "GET" requests, each with different query parameters, on a mock JSON file which holds 5 different tweets. Each tweet has multiple values, such as creation date, tweet ID, tweet content, username and more. 

The 1st API gets the creation time, id, and tweet text of all the tweets available in the file.

The 2nd API gets a list of all external links - all links that appear in tweet text field -  using regular expressions to extract the links and grouping the links based on tweet ids.

The 3rd API gets the tweet creation date, text, and username details about a given tweet (given the tweetâ€™s id).

The 4th API gets detailed profile information: location, description, followers count, and friends count. Info is collected given the Twitter user's username.

This program was written in Python, utilizing the "json", "requests", and "re" built-in libaries.
